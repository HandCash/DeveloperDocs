## Getting Started

### Create a Business Wallet

1. **Access the Developer Dashboard:**  
   Visit the [Handcash Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.handcash.io) and log in with your developer credentials.

2. **Navigate to Wallets:**  
   In the dashboard, go to the **Wallets** section.

3. **Create a New Wallet:**  
   Click on the **Create Wallet** button and follow the prompts to set up your business wallet.

### Manage Payouts

Once your wallet is set up, you can manage payouts using the Handcash Connect SDK.

With your Access Token, you can integrate the Handcash Connect SDK to trigger user payouts.

```javascript
const handCashConnect = new HandcashConnect({
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  appSecret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
});

const account = handCashConnect.getAccountFromAuthToken('<authToken>');

const payParameters = {
  payments: [
    {
      destination: 'myUser',
      currencyCode: 'USD',
      sendAmount: 0.10,
    },
  ],
};

const paymentResult = await account.wallet.pay(payParameters);
console.log({ paymentResult });
```
