The Handcash Market is a feature-rich item marketplace that provides an excellent user experience for games to leverage. It allows item creators to earn a 5% commission on each item listing, while Handcash takes a 4% cut.

## Key Features

### 1. Grouping

Grouping is a powerful feature that enables:
- Bulk buying and selling
- Volume tracking
- Available supply tracking 
- Price history monitoring

Items are grouped together based on the `groupingValue` attribute set during item creation. If the `groupingValue` is not explicitly set, items will be automatically grouped based on their `name`.

Grouping items provides valuable insights and capabilities, such as:
- Tracking the number of owners
- Determining the quantity of similar items in a user's inventory
- Monitoring the current supply
- Identifying the number of unique owners
- Performing bulk operations (buy, sell, edit listing, transfer)
= Price History

### 2. Search Filters

The Handcash Market offers users the ability to filter and search through available items in your game based on various item attributes. To make the most of these filters, it's crucial to set the `displayType` correctly for each attribute when creating items.

## Best Practices

- Do not include `groupingValue` at the time of item creation unless explicitly needed.  Most of the time it makes sense to group items based on the `name`
- Ensure that item attributes have the appropriate `displayType` set. This enables effective filtering and searching for users.
- Leverage the available statistics and insights provided by grouping to make data-driven decisions and optimize your game's economy.

By following these guidelines and leveraging the features of the Handcash Market, you can create a thriving and engaging marketplace experience for your game.
