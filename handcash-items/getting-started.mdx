# Introduction to HandCash Items

HandCash Items leverages the 1Sat ordinal token protocol on BSV to create, manage, and trade digital items. It's designed to abstract blockchain complexities, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without needing in-depth blockchain knowledge.

## Setting Up Credentials

1. Create an application using the [HandCash Developer Dashboard](/developer-dashboard).
   - Save your `AppId` and `AppSecret`.
2. Set up a [Business Wallet](/business-wallet/getting-started).
   - Save your `AccessToken`.

## Item Creation Orders

HandCash Items supports two types of creation orders:
1. Collection creation orders
2. Collection item creation orders

It's recommended to create a single global collection for your application and use item `attributes` to distinguish between different sub-collections.

Item creation orders inscribe items on the blockchain in the background, typically taking less than 5 seconds to complete. You can configure a webhook URL in the app dashboard to receive notifications when your item creation orders are completed.

### Item Creation Order Response

Here's the TypeScript interface for the item creation order response:

```typescript
interface ItemCreationOrderResponse {
  id: string;
  user: string; // Your business wallet ID
  app: string;
  referencedCollection: string;
  type: 'collection' | 'collectionItem';
  status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  pendingInscriptions: number;
  error?: string;
}
```

## Creating a Collection

To create a collection, use the following code and save your `collectionId` for future item creation:

```typescript
import { HandCashMinter, Types } from "@handcash/handcash-connect";

const handCashMinter = HandCashMinter.fromAppCredentials({
  appId: handCashConfig.appId,
  authToken: handCashConfig.authToken,
  appSecret: handCashConfig.appSecret,
});

async function createCollection() {
  const collection: Types.CreateCollectionOrder = {
    name: 'HandCash Team Caricatures',
    description: 'A unique collection of caricatures of the HandCash team',
    mediaDetails: {
      image: {
        url: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/handcash-iae/image/upload/v1685141160/round-handcash-logo_cj47fp_xnteyo_oy3nbd.png',
        contentType: 'image/png',
      },
    },
  };

  const creationOrder = await handCashMinter.createCollectionOrder(collection);
  
  // Wait for collection to be created in the background
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
  
  const items = await handCashMinter.getOrderItems(creationOrder.id);
  console.log(`Collection Created. ID: ${items[0].id}`);
}

(async () => {
  try {
    await createCollection();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating collection:', error);
  }
})();
```
