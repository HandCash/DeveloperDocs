App-Secret: your-app-secret
```

### Updatable Parameters

### Example: Edit Product Name

```bash
curl --request PUT \
     --url https://cloud.handcash.io/v3/paymentRequests/66a2a051d2f2ae72b1f9dd89 \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'App-Id: your-app-id' \
     --header 'App-Secret: your-app-secret' \
     --data '{
       "product": {
         "name": "Updated Haste Hat"
       }
     }'
```

### Example: Decrease Total Supply

*Note: This is only allowed with payment requests that have the `limit` expiration type.*

```bash
curl --request PUT \
     --url https://cloud.handcash.io/v3/paymentRequests/66a2a051d2f2ae72b1f9dd89 \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'App-Id: your-app-id' \
     --header 'App-Secret: your-app-secret' \
     --data '{
       "decreaseRemainingUnits": 2
     }'
```

### Important Notes for Editing

- You can only decrease the remaining units for payment requests with the `limit` expiration type.
- Ensure that you're only updating the fields that you intend to change.
- The `id` in the URL must match an existing payment request associated with your app.
- Any fields not included in the request body will remain unchanged.

## Delete a Payment Request

Replace `{id}` with the ID of the payment request you want to delete.

### Example

```bash

     --header 'app-secret: your-app-secret'
```

### Response

A successful deletion will return a 200 OK status code.

## Best Practices

1. Regularly review and clean up outdated payment requests.
2. Use meaningful names and descriptions for your payment requests to easily identify them when listing.
3. When editing a payment request, only include the fields you want to change to avoid unintended modifications.
4. Always verify the `id` of the payment request you're modifying or deleting to prevent accidental changes to the wrong request.
