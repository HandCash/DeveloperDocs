# Introduction

HandCash Pay is a powerful solution that allows your products to accept payments without requiring users to connect their HandCash account to your app. This is in contrast to HandCash Connect, which requires a deeper integration.

You should consider using HandCash Pay when:

- You need to accept casual payments in your app, as opposed to high-frequency payments.
- You don't need HandCash as a login system, but just need its payment capability.
- You want to offer an alternative checkout flow to your existing payment methods.

# Use Cases

HandCash Pay is designed to be simple to integrate while offering powerful features through its API and webhook system. This combination of simplicity and flexibility makes it ideal for various use cases:

1. **Paywalls**: Allow users to pay to unlock content from your app, such as playing a game, purchasing items, or reading an article. Your server will be notified every time a payment is successfully completed.

2. **Checkouts**: Accept payments for your business with ease.

3. **Purchase Single Items**: Generate individual and reusable payment links for each of your app items.

## Real-World Example

The [HandCash Items market](https://market.handcash.io) is built on top of HandCash Pay. In this implementation:

1. Every time an item is listed, a payment request is created for that item.
2. When a purchase is made, the purchaser is transferred the item.

This demonstrates how HandCash Pay can be used to create a robust marketplace system.

# Getting Started
