## Getting Started

### Create a Business Wallet

1. **Access the Developer Dashboard:**  
   Visit the [Handcash Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.handcash.io) and log in with your developer credentials.

2. **Navigate to Wallets:**  
   In the dashboard, go to the **Wallets** section.

3. **Create a New Wallet:**  
   Click on the **Create Wallet** button and follow the prompts to set up your business wallet. Once 2fA is completed, save the wallet `AccessToken` to be used in the next steps.

### Manage Payouts

Once your wallet is set up, you can manage payouts using the HandCash SDK v3.

A common use case is for hourly payouts from the business wallet to the top of the leader board.

With your Access Token, you can integrate the HandCash SDK to trigger user payouts.

```typescript
import { getInstance, Connect } from '@handcash/sdk';

const sdk = getInstance({
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  appSecret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
});

const client = sdk.getAccountClient('<accessToken>');

const { data, error } = await Connect.pay({
  client,
  body: {
    instrumentCurrencyCode: 'BSV',
    denominationCurrencyCode: 'USD',
    receivers: [
      {
        destination: '<RECIPIENT_HANDLE | WALLET_ID>',
        sendAmount: 0.10,
      },
    ],
  },
});

if (error) throw error;
console.log({ paymentResult: data });
```
