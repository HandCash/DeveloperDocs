# Craft and Burn Items

## Overview

HandCash Items provides powerful functionality to manage the lifecycle of digital items within your application. Two key features are:

1. **Burning Items**: Remove items from a user's inventory, destroying them permanently.
2. **Crafting Items**: Create new items by combining or upgrading existing ones.

These features allow you to implement complex item economies and upgrade systems in your applications.

## Burning Items

Burning items removes them from a user's inventory and destroys them permanently. This process automatically decreases the circulating supply of the particular group of items.

**The HandcashMinter must be initialized with the users connect authorization token who owns the items in which you wish to burn**

### Example: Burn Items

```typescript
import { HandCashConnect, HandCashMinter } from '@handcash/handcash-connect';

const handCashConnect = new HandCashConnect({ 
   appId: '<app-id>', 
   appSecret: '<secret>',
}); 

const handCashMinter = HandCashMinter.fromAppCredentials({
  appId: process.env.HANDCASH_APP_ID,
  authToken: process.env.HANDCASH_AUTH_TOKEN, // Users connected authorization token
  appSecret: process.env.HANDCASH_APP_SECRET
});

async function burnItems(origin: string) {
  const burnOrderResult = await handCashMinter.burnAndCreateItemsOrder({
    burn: {
      origins: [origin],
    }
  });

  console.log('Burn Order Result:', burnOrderResult);
}
```

## Crafting Items

Crafting allows you to burn existing items and simultaneously create new ones. This is useful for implementing upgrade systems or item combinations in games.

### Example: Craft Items

```typescript
import { HandCashConnect, HandCashMinter } from '@handcash/handcash-connect';

const handCashConnect = new HandCashConnect({ 
   appId: '<app-id>', 
   appSecret: '<secret>',
}); 

const handCashMinter = HandCashMinter.fromAppCredentials({
  appId: process.env.HANDCASH_APP_ID,
  authToken: process.env.HANDCASH_AUTH_TOKEN,
  appSecret: process.env.HANDCASH_APP_SECRET
});

async function craftItems(collectionId: string) {
  // Get items from user's inventory
  const handcashAccount = await handCashConnect.getAccountFromAuthToken('<user-auth-token>');
  let items = await handcashAccount.items.getItemsInventory({ 
    searchString: 'Rafa', 
    collectionId, 
    groupingValue: '0df774cab8b1c51d6d74fccd577fe436' 
  });
  
  const itemsToBurn = items.slice(0, 2);

  // Define the new item to create
  const itemToCreate = {
    // Define your new item properties here
  };

  // Burn 2 "Rafa" items to craft 1 "Alex" item
  let burnOrderResult = await handCashMinter.burnAndCreateItemsOrder({
    burn: {
      origins: itemsToBurn.map((item: any) => item.origin),
    },
    issue: {
      items: [itemToCreate],
      collectionId: collectionId,
    }
  });

  console.log('Craft Order Result:', burnOrderResult);
}
```

## Important Considerations

1. **Supply Tracking**: The supply of items is automatically tracked. When items are burned, the circulating supply decreases.
2. **Irreversible Process**: Burning items is permanent and cannot be undone. Ensure proper validation before executing burn orders.
3. **User Authentication**: Make sure you have the correct authentication key for the user whose items you're manipulating.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to manage cases where items might not exist or the user doesn't have sufficient items to burn.

## Best Practices

1. **Confirm Actions**: Always confirm with users before burning their items, especially if it's a valuable or rare item.
2. **Clear Communication**: Clearly communicate the results of crafting to users, showing what items were used and what new item was created.
3. **Balanced Economy**: Design your crafting system carefully to maintain a balanced item economy in your application.
4. **Logging**: Keep detailed logs of all burn and craft operations for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.
