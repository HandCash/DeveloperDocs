<Note>
Items (Minter) APIs are pending v3 release. Until then, use the legacy package examples. This page will be updated when v3 is available.

## Strategy

- Create a single top-level collection for your app.
- Use item attributes to categorize sub-types (rarity, season, set, etc.).
- Keep immutable metadata minimal and reference off-chain metadata via URLs for flexibility.
